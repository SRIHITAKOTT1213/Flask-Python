I try my best to explore new things, but most of the time, I like to stay home and watch something on my laptop (mostly when I don't have to worry about homework. One thing that I wish I could do is travel more. I think people who travel a lot don't like to travel, and people who don't travel enough love to travel. I fall into the catagory of not travelling enough. Especially with the pandemic I think that it is more important to start travelling now and get out there. That's pretty much it. I don't like to do much, especially alone. And I'll do anything with friends and family. One thing everyone knows about me is that I am a very (and I mean very) social person. I'll choose to be around people any where and any time.</strong></p></td></tr> </table>
